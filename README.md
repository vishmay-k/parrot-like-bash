This is for the one who cloned the repo. 

It just contains what wiki has.

Its just a .bashrc files contents which can be used on any linux distro running bash terminal.

U just have to be on your home folder.

cd ~

Then type in (make sure u have leafpad installed or use any other text editor. nano can also be used).

sudo leafpad .bashrc

And then clear the contents of the file and paste the contents of that .bashrc file into your .bashrc file.

And save file and exit the terminal and reopen.
